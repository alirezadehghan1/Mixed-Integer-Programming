# Mixed-Integer-Programming


In this Operations Research project, it has been conducted mathematical modeling and solving a production scheduling problem using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques. The problem is tackled using both Python and the GAMS softwares. Implementation of the model using Python by either GurobiPy or Pyomo libraries and CPLEX as solver for the optimization. Furthermore, the results has been analyzed and visualized by utilizing Gantt chart and sensitivity analysis.
